# Torrent_movies_free_downloader
This code contains a simple and very efficient method to download any torrent movie without any external software support
## A simple torrent downloader written in Python 3.

### This Torrent Downloader uses Webtorrent-CLI as download handler. For that we need to setup nodejs and npm

### as many of the current devlopers have nodejs and npm installed in their systems ,I didn't add it to the extra softwares required.


- You can use the same code for streaming in chromecast,VLC,airplay,mplayer etc
  - You can visit this open source site to know more about them [Web-Torrent CLI](https://github.com/webtorrent/webtorrent-cli).


- As this is a python file ,I'm assuming that everyone who uses this code would have installed python3 and pip.

Let's run the python script now! Run the script using the command

```python3 TorrentDownloader.py```



                                                No CopyRights Reserved , you can use this code anywhere,anytime.
                                                                      Happy Coding!
